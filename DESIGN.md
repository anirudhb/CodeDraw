**Theme: STEM**

Idea!!!

App / program to learn coding

Principles:
* NO KEYBOARD
* Mouse / touch only
* Never make them comprehend technicalities

Real-life anecdote:
* My sister. She hates using the keyboard. She says, why do I need to type all of these things to make something?

Example demo:

Write "ask" on screen

As you say "so first ask what is their name?"

Write "say" on screen

As you say "then say hello and their name"

Then while saying "name" write "!"

Run

Asks: "What is your name?"

User gives input

Says/writes: "Hello \<name>!"
